export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a passionate frontend developer and data analyst with a knack for creating beautiful and functional user interfaces. I have a strong 
foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. My goal is to improve the enviroment and the targets of ML (Machine Learning)
 and the new system of the web (WEB 3.0) .`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I’m a curious and innovative developer with a passion for understanding how things work—whether it’s the human brain, machine learning algorithms, or the psychology 
behind great design. Over the past 2 years, I’ve combined my love for technology and aesthetics to build efficient, visually engaging web applications that leave a lasting impression. 
My expertise spans React, Node.js, Java Swing, XML, and database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and PHP MyAdmin. I enjoy experimenting with 3D visuals, interactive interfaces, and bold color schemes to create unique user experiences.
 Beyond web development, I leverage Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, turning raw data into compelling stories.`;
